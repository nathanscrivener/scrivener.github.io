    c)  Commits a substantial breach of the Agreement (including failing to rectify defective work, failing to comply with its health and safety obligations, or failing to maintain the required insurances) and fails to remedy that breach within five (5) Working Days of receiving written notice from the Principal specifying the breach and requiring remedy;

    e)  Assigns or transfers shares in the Contractor so that effective control of the Contractor passes to persons other than those holding it at the date of this Agreement without the Principal’s prior written consent.

9.3.1   If terminated by Principal for Default:** The Contractor must immediately cease work, secure its work area, remove its personnel (unless otherwise directed for safety), and leave the Site. The Principal may complete the Works itself or engage Other Contractors. The Contractor shall only be entitled to payment for the value of the Works properly completed up to the termination date (as reasonably assessed by the Principal), less: (i) any amounts already paid; (ii) any retentions held; (iii) any costs incurred by the Principal due to the Contractor's default; and (iv) the extra costs reasonably incurred or anticipated by the Principal in completing the Works compared to the balance of the original Contract Price. If these costs exceed the unpaid value of work, the difference shall be a debt due from the Contractor to the Principal. No further compensation (including loss of profit) is payable.

9.3.2 **If terminated by Principal for Convenience:** The Contractor must cease work as directed, secure its area, and demobilise. The Principal shall pay the Contractor for:

    a)  The value of the Works properly completed up to the effective date of termination (as reasonably assessed by the Principal); plus

    b)  The reasonable, substantiated, and unavoidable costs directly incurred by the Contractor solely due to the termination (e.g., cancellation costs for non-returnable materials ordered prior to notice of termination, demobilisation costs), provided the Contractor takes all reasonable steps to mitigate such costs.

Payment excludes any allowance for loss of anticipated profit or overhead recovery on the uncompleted portion of the Works.

9.3.3   **Termination does not affect accrued rights:** Termination under this clause does not prejudice any rights or remedies that accrued prior to termination.

9.4 **Termination by Contractor:** The Contractor may terminate the Agreement only if the Principal:

    a)  Commits a substantial breach of a fundamental term (which, for clarity, is limited to failing to pay a correctly scheduled undisputed amount certified in a Payment Schedule for more than 30 Working Days after the due date, where such failure is not due to a valid deduction or withholding right under the Agreement or CCA); or

    b)  Becomes insolvent.

9.5 Before terminating, the Contractor must give the Principal at least ten (10) Working Days' written notice specifying the substantial breach and requiring it to be remedied. If the Principal remedies the breach within the notice period, the termination notice lapses. If terminated validly under this clause, the Contractor is entitled to payment as if terminated for convenience.

10.0 **CARE AND PROTECTION OF THE SITE**

10.1    The Contractor is responsible for the care of its Works and materials/plant under its control on Site from the time it commences its Works until Practical Completion of its Works is achieved.

10.2    The Contractor shall maintain a clean and organised work area throughout the project, minimising dust, debris, and waste.

    b)  Existing property on or adjacent to the Site;

    c)  Third parties or their property.

10.5    The Contractor shall rectify such damage promptly at its cost upon notification by the Principal. If the Contractor fails to do so, the Principal may rectify the damage and recover the reasonable costs incurred from the Contractor (including by way of deduction).
